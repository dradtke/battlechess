.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Concatenate two path structures.
The first path structure is modified.
If `tail' is an absolute path, this function does nothing.
.PP
If `tail' is a relative path, all of its directory components will be
appended to `path'.
tail's filename will also overwrite path's filename, even if it is just
the empty string.
.PP
Tail's drive is ignored.
.PP
Returns true if `tail' was a relative path and so concatenated to
`path', otherwise returns false.
